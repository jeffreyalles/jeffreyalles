### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jeff. I build and maintain scalable WordPress-based sites. Lately I've been extremely into Ansible. I'm passionate about automation, privacy, and encryption. In a prior life I worked in the non-profit and space communities. I hold a degree in Aeronautical Science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
